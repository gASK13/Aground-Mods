        <text id="potato1">Wow, is that a [item=potato]? Haven't seen one since I was a little kid!</text>
        <text id="potato2">One of the first experiments I did was making a [item=potato_battery] out of one of those.</text>
        <text id="potato3">Here, let me show you, I should have some wire right here...</text>
        <text id="potato4">There you go. It is not very powerful, but it can be made anywhere as long as you have a [item=potato] and some spare [item=iron].</text>
        <text id="potato5">I also made a big [item=spud_cannon] once.</text>
        <text id="potato6">What do you think? If you bring me some stuff, we can build one together!</text>
        <text id="potato_a1">Did you change your mind about that [item=spud_cannon]?</text>
        <text id="potato_f1">You brought everything? Let's meet at the factory then!</text>
        <text id="potato_f2">All done. Now you can start a real food fight!</text>

        <text id="potato1">Is that a [item=potato]? Where did you get that, man?</text>
        <text id="potato2">Let me turn it into a [item=potato_seed] so you can plant it.</text>
        <text id="potato2b">If you need more of those, just come to me and I can help you.</text>
        <text id="potato3">Oh! You know what? I haven't got a [item=baked_potato] in ages!</text>
        <text id="b_potato2">Would you be a good sport and fix me one?</text>
        <text id="b_potato3">...actually, make that two, please!</text>
        <text id="b_potato_f1">Mmm, this smells delicious! Now excuse me, this is best eaten still hot...</text>
        <text id="b_potato_f2">Thank you! That was delicious. I got some more potato recipes, so feel free to try them in the kitchen.</text>

        <text id="potato1">I heard you found a [item=potato] somewhere? Is that true?</text>
        <text id="potato2">You know, back when I was young, we used to make a drink from them. It allowed me to see spirits for the first time.</text>
        <text id="potato3">If you help me gather the needed ingredients, I can show you how it's made!</text>
        <text id="potato4">Great! Come find me at my lab when you have the needed ingredients!</text>
        <text id="come_to_lab">You got the ingredients? Great! Meet me at my lab and I will prepare the drink.</text>
        <text id="potato_f1">Ah, I see you've gathered everything.</text>
        <text id="potato_f2">This will take a while, it involves a lenghty distillation.</text>
        <text id="potato_f3">Good, now we need to distill it once more.</text>
        <text id="potato_f4">Here! All done! The drink that will let you see the spirits - [item=vodka]!</text>
        <text id="potato_f5">I left the recipe in the lab in case you need to make more.</text>

        <text id="potato2">You know, back when I was young, we used to make a drink from them. Some say it allowed them to talk to the spirits of nature.</text>
        <text id="potato3">If you help me gather the needed ingredients, I can show you how it's made!</text>
        <text id="potato4">Great! Come find me when you have the needed ingredients!</text>
        <text id="potato_f1">Ah, I see you've gathered everything.</text>
        <text id="potato_f2">This will take a while - the process involves a lenghty distillation and extraction.</text>
        <text id="potato_f4">Here! The [item=vodka] is done! Don't be disappointed if the drink does nothing - the talk about spirits was probably just a fairy tale.</text>
        <text id="potato_f5">If you have access to a lab, you can easily make more there.</text>
