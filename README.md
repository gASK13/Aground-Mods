# Aground Mods

This is a collection of all the mods I made for [Aground](https://store.steampowered.com/app/876650/Aground/), a nice survival / crafting game built with extensibility in mind.

Some of those are full fledged mods, some are frameworks for others to build upon, some are experiments or PoCs and some are just skeletons of the amibitious ideas that borne them.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me!

IF you're looking to install the mods, you can find those (and others) over at [mod.io](https://aground.mod.io/).
