      <text id="smastirini1">The rest of this log is too corrupted to read. I wonder if those droids are still around...</text>
      <text id="smastirini2">These logs suggest this ship was part of a larger mission...</text>
      <text id="smastirini3">I am picking up a distress signal! I wonder if there might still be survivors...</text>
      <text id="smastirini4">No signs of life... This signal must have been sent long ago...</text>
      <text id="smastirini5">These are the logs of the Research Vessel the ESA-Smastirini. Our mission was simple: test some drones, return home to Earth.</text>
      <text id="smastirini6">At first, all seemed well. But when we disengaged our FTL engines, we knew we were in the wrong place. Something.. something had altered our path.</text>
      <text id="smastirini7">We began to fear... but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. We started testing our drones... and then it all went wrong.</text>
      <text id="smastirini8">On day 3, the first ship dissapeared. One second it was there, the next it was gone. Someone gave Them a name... the nameless force opposing us.</text>
      <text id="smastirini9">On day 8, we had harvested enough Exotic Matter for the FTL jump back. But when we engaed the engines, nothing happened. And then all went to hell.</text>
      <text id="smastirini10">The drones turned on us. They destroyed us. Some of our ships may have been able to get away, but I find that possibility unlikely...</text>
      <text id="smastirini11">I can hear them coming now... Goodbye... I hope this log serves as warning to any who may come after...</text>
      <text id="ambush1">These people have been long dead... so who sent the signal?</text>
      <text id="ambush2">It was a trap! The signal was a fake! I must get out of here!</text>
      <text id="give_utility_droid">It seems this ship specialized in drones. Most of the data is corrupted but I can still extract the plans for a [item=utility_droid]!</text>

      <text id="pirates1">I see you found an [color=770000]Asteroid Field[/color]! I have checked your ship's scanners and they are picking up activity in the area.</text>
      <text id="pirates2">I have reason to suspect it is pirates. Let me just run some tests... [pause=1]Aha! I have locked onto a signal from the pirates' base!</text>
      <text id="pirates3">If you can go and eradicate them, I might be able to make something out of their tech!</text>
      <text id="pirates4">I have killed the pirates the [object=mechanic] asked for... I'll call her on the [item=com_device].</text>
      <text id="pirates5">Cass? I killed the pirates you asked.</text>
      <text id="pirates6">Great! Can you search their base for some [item=advanced_tech]?</text>
      <text id="pirates7">Here's the tech you wanted.</text>
      <text id="pirates8">Awesome! I can make so much new tech with this! Go check out the new recipies in the [color=770000]Advanced Lab[/color]!</text>

        <text id="no_entry">Hey! Get out of there!</text>
        <text id="gather_stuff1">Hello there traveler! Could you spare some time to help us?</text>
        <text id="gather_stuff2">The pirates in the vicinity keep attacking our operations. We require some materials to repair our defense systems.</text>
        <text id="gather_stuff3">If you could obtain some of the pirate's tech... we might be able to fight them off.</text>
        <text id="gather_stuff4">Amazing! I will use this to craft some new tech in our [color=770000]Lab[/color]! Feel free to use our facilities as you please!</text>
        <text id="mine_beam1">We have been developing a new laser beam, but it requires large amounts of [item=magnegem]s to complete. Could you get some?</text>
        <text id="mine_beam2">This is exactly what we need! Feel free to craft a [item=fighter.mine] in the [color=770000]Lab[/color]!</text>
        <text id="thanks">Thank you for all your help, traveller! Feel free to borrow any resources you need!</text>
        <text id="destroyed">The pirates must have destroyed this base... I'll see what I can salvage from the poor miners...</text>
        <text id="com_device">You can call us on your [item=com_device] to find your way back here if needed.</text>
        <text id="call1">Greetings traveler! I am transmitting our location now...</text>
        <text id="call2">Location transmitted! We await your return!</text>
