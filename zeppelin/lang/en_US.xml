      <text id="build_airship1">Hey, what is that bulge in your backpack?</text>
      <text id="build_airship2">What is this? A [item=helium_sac] from a [color=770000][tile=skyfish] Skyfish[/color] you say? It seems to be lighter then air!</text>
      <text id="build_airship3">If you bring me some more [item=helium_sac]s, I might be able to create something useful from them. Like an airship!</text>
      <text id="build_airship4">You got the [item=helium_sac]s? Excellent! We need to go to the factory immidiately!</text>  
      <text id="build_airship5">There, all done! Why don't you take your new [object=zeppelin] for a test flight?</text>
      <text id="build_airship6">I already have some ideas how to improve this design, so be sure to check the [color=ff2222]Factory[/color] for some improvements.</text>
      <text id="build_airship_cave">There, all done! Why don't you take your new [object=zeppelin] for [pause=4]...Oh!</text>
      <text id="build_airship_cave2">I did not realize an airship in a cave is not very useful. Well, at least it can serve as a nice decoration, eh?</text>
